# Data-Structures
Assignments for the Data Structures course in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. The assignments include the implementation of a Hunger Games game in Java.

It is a simplified Java version of Hunger Games. Two players move on a board, collect weapons and food, avoid traps, and try to survive.

This is an example of the game's board :

(There is also an attempt at implementing the game's graphics as part of a bonus assignment but requires improvement.)

TODO: check / improve graphics.
